        <h1>The coolest creature</h1>

        <p>The <strong><em>Gorilla</em> is awesome because</strong>Gorillas are ground-dwelling, predominantly <strong><em>herbivorous apes</em></strong> that inhabit the <strong><em>forest</em></strong> of central <strong><em>Sub-Saharan Africa</em></strong>. The <strong>genus</strong> <em>Gorilla</em> is divided into two species: the <strong>eastern gorillas</strong> and the <strong>western gorillas</strong> (both <strong>critically endangered</strong>), and either four or five <strong>subspecies</strong>. They are the largest <strong>living primates</strong>. The <strong>DNA</strong> of gorillas is highly similar to that of <strong><em>humans</em></strong>, from 95 to 99% depending on what is included, and they are the next closest living relatives to <strong><em>humans</em></strong> after the <strong><em> chimpanzees</em></strong> and bonobos. .</p>
